# awsautomation
Exercise I was going through to automate deployment of AWS infrastructure using Terraform.

You will need terraform installed for the code to work, as well as have a functioning AWS account. The keys are purposefully empty fields to insert keys from your specific AWS account. 

I will later be updating this code so the user will not need to upload their specific keys into a main file.
